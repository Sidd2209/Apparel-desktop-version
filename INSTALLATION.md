   ```bash
   pkill -f "Apparel Flow Desktop"
   ```

2. **Check port 8080:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   ```
   If something is using port 8080, stop that application first.

3. **Use the debug script:**
   ```bash
   ./debug-app.sh
   ```

4. **Check Console.app for errors:**
   - Open Console.app (Applications > Utilities > Console)
   - Search for "Apparel Flow Desktop"
   - Look for error messages

2. **Security settings:**
   - macOS: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy

3. **Port conflicts:**

   - Delete: `~/Library/Application Support/Apparel Flow Desktop`
   - Restart the app
